# install npm@1 so we can install npm@2 so we can ensure we have the latest version (can't install npm@2 directly on 0.8 as their bundled npm is too old)
# ensure coffee-script is installed (needed for cake commands)
# ensure dev dependencies are installed (handled via npm install)
# ensure test dependencies are installed (handled via cake install)
install: "npm install -g npm@1 && npm install -g npm@2 && npm install coffee-script && npm install && ./node_modules/.bin/cake install"
